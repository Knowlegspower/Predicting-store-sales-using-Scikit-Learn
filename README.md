# Predicting store sales using Scikit-Learn

## Description
Our program makes predictions and forecasts of probable weekly sales of Walmart stores based on [historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting), which is given from 45 different Walmart stores. Our historical data-set has sequential nature, that is, it takes time range from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Hence, to predict the sales we used bunch of algorithms, which are [Linear Regression](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&hs=3Uu&lei=BEHKX5WKOYutrgTe3qjQBQ&q=linear%20regression%20python%20pandas&ved=2ahUKEwiVnPa0vrTtAhWLlosKHV4vCloQsKwBKAB6BAgiEAE&biw=1475&bih=674), [MLPregressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor.html), [Extra Trees Regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.html), and [Random Forest Regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html), which all can be found in [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), Also we will identify sales on each department of the stores and affect of markdowns such as holidays on the sales. Machine Learning can help as to identify where is minimum or no correlation between sales and factors given as in data. By applying machine learning and listed algorithms we can achieve our challenge to predict store sales using Scikit-Learn.
